# human_mosquito_manuscript

Summary: This repository provides the code and data needed to conduct the analyses described in the manuscript: Direct measurement of relative contributions of asymptomatic and symptomatic Plasmodium falciparum infections to malaria transmission. 

System requirements: All code was implemented using R (version 3.6.1). R can be installed here: https://cran.rstudio.com/

Files included: 
1) 2 data sets representing the paired edgelists for the pfama1 and pfcsp parasite gene targets. Each edgelist row consists of a human-mosquito pair. 
2) R scripts for implementing the statistical analyses, probabilistic modelling, and figure creation presented in the manuscript.
